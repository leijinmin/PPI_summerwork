==============
Desciption  
--------
The relevant matlab code about protein-protein interactions prediction work.
References 
--------
The implementations of relevant algorithms are based on [(KM Borgwardt et al,2005)'s paper "Protein function prediction via graph kernels"](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/suppl_1/i47.full.pdf+html) and [(Jean-Philippe Vert,200)'s "Reconstruction of biological networks by supervised machine learning approaches"](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00283945v2). 
Implementations of main algorithms
--------
* Protein graph
* Random walk graph kernel
* PPIs kernels

Author
--------
The protein graph model and the random walk graph kernel are implemented by Jinmin Lei; the PPIs kernels are implemented by Jana Kludas
